# Svelte(Kit) examples

A collection of Svelte(Kit) examples showcasing various use cases, apps and integrations.

## Creating a new example

Before creating a new example, please first open an issue to discuss it. Here are a few rules to keep in mind:

- examples should be focused on a specific use case (TODO app) or technology (how to integrate TailwindCSS), but not both if possible
- examples should be self-contained and minimal so that people can grasp them quickly. At the same time, it should not be too closely related to other examples. It may be better to enhance an existing example sometimes to group things
- examples should be stable so that maintenance effort is low

Once a new example is agreed upon, a PR is welcome to implement it. Guidelines for creating an example:

- the example should contain a `README.md` that describes what the example is about and some of the technical decisions that were made/packages that were used
- it should look visually pleasing while not requiring too much code to make it that way. E.g. a bunch of styles tucked a way in a `style` is ok, a Svelte transition/animation here and there is ok, but a bunch of HTML/JS code only related to visuals should be avoided
