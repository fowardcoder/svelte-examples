# Svelte(Kit) examples

A collection of Svelte(Kit) examples showcasing various use cases, apps and integrations.

## Creating a new example

Before creating a new example, please first open an issue to discuss it. Here are a few rules to keep in mind:

- examples should be focused on a specific use case (TODO app) or technology (how to integrate TailwindCSS), but not both if possible
- examples should be self-contained and minimal so that people can grasp them quickly
- examples should be stable so that maintenance effort is low

Once a new example is agreed upon, a PR is welcome to implement it. The example should contain a `README.md` that describes what the example is about and some of the technical decisions that were made/packages that were used.
